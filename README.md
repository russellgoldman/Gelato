# Inspiration
The inspiration for this app was experiencing the feeling of being bored with class because of the way the information is delivered. While some are great at memorizing concepts from a textbook, some need a more experiential, hands on way of interacting with education content.

# What it does
Our web app allows teachers to put together education content such as quizzes and other practice material into a dashboard which the app then uses to populate questions with a game. The student section functions like an RPG game based on the content the teacher has made for their class.

# How we built it
We used React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js to build this app.

# Challanges
Being able to time manage and prioritize features was a challenge as we had many more feature ideas than could be implemented in a weekend.
